4e) const obj= {

  "key1": "value1",
  
  "key2" : "value2",
  
  "key3" : "value3"
  
  }
  
  const obj2 = { ...obj}
  
  console.log(obj2 === obj)

  What is the output of question 4e?


false , because key and values are different


true


false, because the objects point to different references


none of the above
